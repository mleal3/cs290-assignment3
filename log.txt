Tasks: Worked on Assignment 3, Part 2 for many hours. Most of it

End: Sun, 25 Apr 2015 19:18:51 -0700
Tasks: Finished index.html and began working on src.js. I rewatched all of the videos lectures and spent the majority of the day reading but I am very lost. I read all of the Piazza posts but I am unsure of what to do. I have no expericene with js. I would like to see working code afterwards to see what is expected.
